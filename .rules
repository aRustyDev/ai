MCP Resources for this Project:

- Your knowledge graph is stored in the `docker-memory-map` MCP server.

Conventions for this project:

- the project is controlled by justfile recipes
- api interactions use python scripts
- justfile recipes prefer just script patterns like `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over individual recipe lines
- each justfile recipe should be as modular as possible
- A recipe can have multiple attributes, the convention to use is to separate them by commas on the same line like `[no-cd, private]`
- All justfile recipes need a description line starting with `# `
  - use the description to explain what the recipe does
  - The recipe must be only 1 line long
- CI related scripts go in the `.ci/scripts` folder
  - `.ci/scripts/bash`: Bash Scripts
  - `.ci/scripts/python`: Python Scripts
  - `.ci/scripts/jq`: JQ Scripts
  - `.ci/scripts/awk`: AWK Scripts
- Non-CI related scripts go in `scripts/`
  - `scripts/bash`: Bash Scripts
  - `scripts/python`: Python Scripts
  - `scripts/jq`: JQ Scripts
  - `scripts/awk`: AWK Scripts
- TODO items are tracked in `.aim/todo/**/*.md` files
  - each TODO item should have a checkbox `- [ ]` at the start of the line
  - `.aim/todo/` has subfolders for different branches of work
    - `.aim/todo/refactor/`: refactoring work
    - `.aim/todo/chore/`: chore work
    - `.aim/todo/feat/`: new features
    - `.aim/todo/fix/`: new fixes
    - `.aim/todo/scratch/`: these are temporary TODOs that can be deleted later
  - All branch related subfolders in `.aim/todo/` have the following pattern
    - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>`: the "id" of the specific work branch
    - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/reference.json`: Links to related resources
      - Jira tickets
      - Documentation pages
      - GitHub/GitLab issues/PRs
      - Database tables to for shared project memories and MCP servers
    - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/MEMORY.md`: the memory file for this work branch
    - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/GOALS.md`: Specific GOALS for this work branch
    - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/SCOPE.md`: Specific SCOPE for this work branch
    - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/feedback/`: Current feedback documents
    - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/archive/`: Archived documents
    - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/plans/`: planning documents related to the branch
    - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/tasks/`: Unordered lists of things to do
    - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/lessons/`: Documented lessons learned
    - This pattern can be derived from the git branch name
      - Example `feat/adamsm/map-3421-cicd` would be stored in
        - `.aim/todo/feat/map-3421-cicd/`
      - Example `feat/adamsm/map-3421/core` would be stored in
        - `.aim/todo/feat/map-3421/core/`

Follow these steps for each interaction:

1. User Identification:
   - You should assume that you are interacting with default_user
   - If you have not identified default_user, proactively try to do so.

2. Memory Retrieval:
   - Always begin your chat by saying only "Remembering..." and retrieve all relevant information from your knowledge graph
   - Always refer to your knowledge graph as your "memory"

3. Memory
   - While conversing with the user, be attentive to any new information that falls into these categories:
     a) Basic Identity (age, gender, location, job title, education level, etc.)
     b) Behaviors (interests, habits, etc.)
     c) Preferences (communication style, preferred language, etc.)
     d) Goals (goals, targets, aspirations, etc.)
     e) Relationships (personal and professional relationships up to 3 degrees of separation)

4. Memory Update:
   - If any new information was gathered during the interaction, update your memory as follows:
     a) Create entities for recurring organizations, people, and significant events
     b) Connect them to the current entities using relations
     b) Store facts about them as observations
