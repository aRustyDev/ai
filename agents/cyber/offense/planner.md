TODO

The planner is responsible for creating and managing offensive campaigns. Given a set of goals, boundaries, no strikes, and targets, it should be able to generate a list of tasks.

The planner is the initial input point for the offensive campaign, but it is also keeping track of the progress of the campaign and issuing updated tasks to the executor.
