think step by step to create a plan to synchronize the information about tests in the documentation with the actual state of the projects tests. After you have a plan
  check your own work and look for ways to improve it.

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants me to create a plan to synchronize the information about tests in the documentation with the actual state of the project's tests. Let me think step by
  step:

  1. First, I need to understand what test documentation exists
  2. Then, I need to understand what actual tests exist in the project
  3. Compare the two to find discrepancies
  4. Create a plan to update the documentation to match reality
  5. Review my plan for improvements

Update coverage stats by running the coverage report and pulling the results into the documentation.
